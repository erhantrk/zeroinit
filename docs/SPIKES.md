- size: 78,519 bytes (`wc -c`)
- `shasum -a 256` hex: `912ae75e72dd90173a8e0c6c3225927b7a68ae66788df704c8bf8979c543c3c9`
- code hash (base58 of sha256): `Amg4WXKyZe2RAyjUjtX2cgU4RW5615abgccyKtiUGW6k`
- cargo-near version: `cargo-near-near 0.23.0`
- contract tests: `test result: ok. 7 passed; 0 failed`
